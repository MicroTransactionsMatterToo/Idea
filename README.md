#**Ideas**
### Just a place to jot down any idea's one might have
## Use
---
This repo is a sort of dumping ground for any and all ideas that you might come up with, but don't have time to work on. The purpose of this is to allow people who may not have as many ideas, but do have the time, to find cool projects to work on. Anybody may add an idea to the repo, simply clone it, make a new branch, push, and then send a pull request. I'll check your idea and decide whether to include it or not. More details on how this is done [here](http://placehold).

## Claiming an idea
---
>If an idea has not been marked as claimed, you may claim it (see [here](http://placehold) for example)

To claim and idea, follow the instructions above.
If a claim has already been made and you would still like to contribute, a link to the project inspired by the idea should be present at the bottom of the .lightbulb file. You should then be able to follow that link and contribute to that project.
